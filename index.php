   * FUN FACTS
   * Some fun facts we can gather about the serial numbers in goat and sheep collections
   * Some questions I'd like to explore:
   * - What is the average length of a serial number?
   * - Are any of the serial numbers palindromes?
   * - How many times does each digit 0 - 9 appear in each set of serial numbers?
   * - What is the most popular digit in the serial numbers of each collection?
   * - What is the average (mean) of the serial numbers in each collection?
   * - What is the median of the set of digits of the mean of the serial numbers in each collection?
